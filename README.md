#Home Remote
This repository contains the sources of my Home Remote setup.

After being fed up with using different IR remotes to control my TV, set top box & home cinema, I decided to use an arduino ethernet to control these devices.

The arduino receives commands over UDP, which trigger IR leds (and an octocoupler to trigger my set top box).

More updates (arduino layout, alternative inputs) in the future.
